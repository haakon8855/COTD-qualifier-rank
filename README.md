# COTD Qualification Rank

This plugin for Trackmania 2020 is made to display what your COTD qualification rank
on would be with your current PB. This works on older TOTD too. This can be useful to check your
progress when playing older TOTD where medals may be of different difficulty levels or
the map itself might be grinded more by players after COTD.
